Part I:\
\
Pac's Labyrinth \
\
Imagine you wake up in unknown location, surrounded by giant blue walls. You think you hear something, it sounds like a ghost. You start to run, trying to get away, to escape this unknown monster. You think you've almost made it when a spooky purple ghost (named Clyde) materializes right in front of you. You go to turn around only to realize you've been cornered by another Orange ghost. What do you do?\

I think that this whole project was difficult in it's own way. Everything that we did was challenging yet fun at the same time. That's also what was surprising. I was surprised that I could enjoy problem solving at getting stuck repeatedly and have fun doing so. I really enjoyed learning the languages and learning how to code because it was something totally new to me that I found quite enjoyable. I think that the only way that creating this game was possible was through collaboration and getting helped and helping others. I feel that when you help someone it also helps you to learn things and it's great. Some bugs that are in my game would be that since the score is based off a counter, and you get the counter by moving over certain dots, if you stand still on a dot that increases the counter you will win without anybody really moving. That isn't really a bug because it makes sense but there just isn't really way that I could find to fix it. If I had more time to work on my project I would figure out how to fix the counter issue and I'd try to make levels where the ghosts would get more moves per turn then you get. I feel like that would make it better and if I really wanted to code it a lot more I could write a couple of predetermined codes for each ghost to follow and have the game pick one of the codes on the start so that it isn't completely random and it is slightly more unpredictable. This project taught me a ton about programming and how important it is to never give up and keep trying until you solve your problem. It also taught me that there is so much more to game design then what meets the eye. All we see is the finished product and we don't get to see all the handwork that goes into it. I think all of these things that I learned are applicable to life because you shouldn't give up on life and there should be challenges that you need to overcome throughout life. All in all, I really enjoyed this class and I can't wait until next year for AP.\
